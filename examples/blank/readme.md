## Getting Started

### Cloning the repo

```sh
bun create blank ./NAME_HERE
```

### Execute a file (eg. src/index.js)
    
```sh
bun run ./src/index.js
```

### Special notes
- If you run `bun dev` command, it will automatically start a server on port 3000. However there will be no file to serve, hence it will always return 404. To run a  server, please follow the `hono` example.
